If Will Smith does indeed win the Best Actor Oscar for King Richard (2021), it'll be THE MOST unsatisfying Oscar win of all time. I'm talking even more unsatisfying than Denzel Washington winning for Training Day (2001) and Al Pacino winning for Scent of a Woman (1992).

"At first, when ""#KingRichard"" came out, I was troubled that someone whom I saw in the 1990s as a negative influence was celebrated in a film.  Now I see that Richard Williams was attacked for threatening the status quo, by both those in charge and the tennis media who serve them."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466492733170896908	1	rev	p			n

I’m anxious to see it, but does anyone else feel a little frustrated or disappointed that Hollywood chose to tell Venus and Serena Williams’ story thru the prism of their father’s story? I’m def torn on this. To me it should be the other way around. #KingRichard	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466824313642885128	1	rev	o			n

Based on the true story of Venus and @serenawilliams's coach and father, 'King Richard' shows us the toll racism took on a generation of black men – but also the fight it inspired in them.  @Eileen15Jones writes.  https://t.co/k0ycEzYAAa	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466716339419111432	1	rev	p			p

I actually really enjoyed KING RICHARD. You’d think it wouldn’t be a very surprising movie bc you know Venus &amp; Serena become legends.

King Richard. Exactly the movie I thought it would be, for better or worse. Well made, good-hearted &amp; solidly acted. It's also cheesy, vaguely racist &amp; WAY too long.

Venus and Serena, as producers, know exactly what they want to say with KING RICHARD. The stories they choose to tell. How they're told. Those they choose to leave out.

Will Smith tried his best not to coast on his charisma in KING RICHARD but his voice and the constant sour face were distracting. Jon Bernthal surprised me and Aunjanue Ellis stole her scenes. Even when she was just casually reacting I could see so many emotions in her eyes.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468687318303358978	1	act	o			p
KING RICHARD is just nice. Manipulative, overlong, predictable and it looks like a TV movie from the 90s, but the story is really captivating. I wish at least Venus was better developed as a character, it's all about her insufferable dad. The Beyoncé song is incredible.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468687028334309386	1	rev	o			p

Movie Review: King Richard It’s really hard to miss with Will Smith. This movie did a fantastic job of the Williams sisters story.
