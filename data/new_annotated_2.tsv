If Will Smith does indeed win the Best Actor Oscar for King Richard (2021), it'll be THE MOST unsatisfying Oscar win of all time. I'm talking even more unsatisfying than Denzel Washington winning for Training Day (2001) and Al Pacino winning for Scent of a Woman (1992). ANGERING.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466904753191874562	1	act	p	act

For her past three roles, Aunjanue Ellis has earned two Emmy noms (“WTSU” and “Lovecraft County”) and NBR honors (“King Richard”). She currently has no upcoming films or projects in development.

At first, when "#KingRichard" came out, I was troubled that someone whom I saw in the 1990s as a negative influence was celebrated in a film.  Now I see that Richard Williams was attacked for threatening the status quo, by both those in charge and the tennis media who serve them.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466492733170896908	1	rev	p

Based on the true story of Venus and @serenawilliams's coach and father, 'King Richard' shows us the toll racism took on a generation of black men – but also the fight it inspired in them.  @Eileen15Jones writes.  https://t.co/k0ycEzYAAa	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466716339419111432	1	rev	p

KING RICHARD was great in so many ways, but I found it to be a bit contradictory at times, enough to distract me from the film.

I actually really enjoyed KING RICHARD. You’d think it wouldn’t be a very surprising movie bc you know Venus &amp; Serena become legends. But it’s a complex film in terms of character study &amp; how the Williams family navigated their ascension on their own often unfathomable terms.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466647500547260416	1	rev	p

Ok, no baseball talk now. How about movie King Richard, did you like it?

ing Richard is a film that brings a story that not only is amazing but its a touch of empowerment to show us that everything is possible and that if you fight for it you can make it.

King Richard. Exactly the movie I thought it would be, for better or worse. Well made, good-hearted &amp; solidly acted. It's also cheesy, vaguely racist &amp; WAY too long.

I don't know about KING RICHARD, and #PoweroftheDog's shutout stings, but this lot looks better than many recent ones: PTA, Farhadi, #Dune...  Also feeling unexcited about #Belfast as a whole, but any win for Mr. Ciarán Hinds is so lovely.

King Richard (2021): Close your eyes. Imagine an against all odds, heartwarming, slightly comedic telling of the Williams sisters early life, focussed on their dad &amp; starring Will Smith. This movie is EXACTLY what you just imagined. No more, and crucially, no less. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/i4uhW4JOgh	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466489594099212293	1	rev	p

Solid noms. https://t.co/CW2gBgZ82x	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466469727002411017	1	rev	p

Will Smith tried his best not to coast on his charisma in KING RICHARD but his voice and the constant sour face were distracting. Jon Bernthal surprised me and Aunjanue Ellis stole her scenes. Even when she was just casually reacting I could see so many emotions in her eyes.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468687318303358978	1	act	o	
KING RICHARD is just nice. Manipulative, overlong, predictable and it looks like a TV movie from the 90s, but the story is really captivating. I wish at least Venus was better developed as a character, it's all about her insufferable dad. The Beyoncé song is incredible.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468687028334309386	1	rev	o

Loved watching King Richard - story about the Williams sisters. I didn't understand how much Venus paved the way for Serena! Would love to see another film more focused on the goat (Serena) though #SportsTeam21 #ILikeSportsTeam21	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468660983522549767	1	rev	p

Watching KING RICHARD brings back so many memories. I remember how Venus and Serena not only dominated the game in the early days but had all these white folks befuddled cause they got beat by Black folks playing it *their* way which was different (but superior).	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468659259164569612	1	rev	p

I didn’t say no such thing as oppression. I say it is unhelpful to go on about it all the time around kids because they will internalise it and they will think the world is against them.
