If Will Smith does indeed win the Best Actor Oscar for King Richard (2021), it'll be THE MOST unsatisfying Oscar win of all time.

Richard's fate hangs in the balance. He is the illegitimate son of King Richard III.

Even though I've been watching @Venuseswilliams &amp; @serenawilliams their entire career, it's such a gift to get an inside look of the start.

I actually really enjoyed KING RICHARD. You’d think it wouldn’t be a very surprising movie bc you know Venus &amp; Serena become legends. But it’s a complex film in terms of character study &amp; how the Williams family navigated their ascension on their own often unfathomable terms.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466647500547260416
King Richard was a great movie! It was a really good account of the Venus and Serena Williams story growing up and everyone in the cast was brilliant especially Saniyya Sidney who played Venus as a young girl	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466647468662165505

King Richard was such a good movie	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466587614736125954
THE POWER OF THE DOG is at an 74% audience score which is honestly not bad for the kind of film this is. But when you're up against a few films with 90%+ audience reception (BELFAST, KING RICHARD, LICORICE PIZZA), winning BP at the Oscars could be a challenge https://t.co/4KEeYckjrh	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466586827507351559

Ok, no baseball talk now. How about movie King Richard, did you like it?

KING RICHARD was pure beauty. Everyone did such a fantastic job especially the 2 actresses playing Venus and Serena. This story is about them through the eyes of Richard. Will Smith was absolutely fantastic like one of his best performances. To me I think he could win this Oscar https://t.co/Dy2x3Trmjz	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466527379572985862
Can someone honestly tell me why #KingRichard is in this category? The definition on “ensemble” says actors share roughly equal screen time and I saw a whole lot more of WS than anyone else.  #HCAFilmAwards https://t.co/Q7FRq3eDLU	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466526389738229761

King Richard. Exactly the movie I thought it would be, for better or worse. Well made, good-hearted &amp; solidly acted. It's also cheesy, vaguely racist &amp; WAY too long. Solidly pedestrian script. Smith is in higher form, but Bernthal's is the performance of note. Beautifully shot.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466525540110585856

absolutely thrilled for the Aunjanue Ellis NBR win for KING RICHARD. It’s a textbook supporting performance- the impact outsized compared to its screen time- which are too often overlooked for Lead roles that wind up in Supporting. She’s sensational, a scene-stealer.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466506523786588164

“Beyoncé’s contribution to the original song race has been strong, but her ace has been served with “Be Alive,” which plays over the end credits of “King Richard.” The track, a soaring ballad that fits like a glove on the movie, also serves as a standalone single.” 👑 https://t.co/HdSfURPZp2	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1466502387993092096
