Venus and Serena, as producers, know exactly what they want to say with KING RICHARD. The stories they choose to tell. How they're told. Those they choose to leave out. We, outsiders, can't even comprehend what it must've been like. I'm so very thankful for this story.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468688733520252932

Will Smith tried his best not to coast on his charisma in KING RICHARD but his voice and the constant sour face were distracting. Jon Bernthal surprised me and Aunjanue Ellis stole her scenes. Even when she was just casually reacting I could see so many emotions in her eyes.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468687318303358978
KING RICHARD is just nice. Manipulative, overlong, predictable and it looks like a TV movie from the 90s, but the story is really captivating. I wish at least Venus was better developed as a character, it's all about her insufferable dad. The Beyoncé song is incredible.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468687028334309386

King Richard was far too long and the pacing was all over the place. Some of the tennis scenes were far too long and detailed. That said, I really enjoyed the film and the acting was sensational. Aunjanue Ellis, Will Smith, and Saniyya Sidney were all absolutely fantastic.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1468670800672735244
